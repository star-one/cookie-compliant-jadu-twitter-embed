# cookie-compliant-jadu-twitter-embed
A Jadu CMS widget to enable site administrators to embed a Twitter widget in a manner compliant with UK/EU cookie legislation

To use:

Copy the code from front-end.php into the Front end box on a new widget page, and copy the code from settings.php into the Settings box.

When you add the widget to a Jadu Homepage, apply settings to the widget to enter the Twitter handle of the feed you want to embed.

Ideas for enhancement:

1) A setting to set the height of the feed box rather than the height being hardcoded in the widget manager,

2) Making it so when the user clicks Enable it only reloads the <div> that contains the feed rather than reloading the whole page.
